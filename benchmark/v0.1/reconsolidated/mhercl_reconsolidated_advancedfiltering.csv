Anton Stradler, the clarinettist, for whom Mozart wrote his admirable quintet, was not ashamed to take unfair advantage of that generosity. One day, knowing that Mozart had received 50 ducats from the Emperor, Stradler, with tears in. his eyes, . came and begged the composer. to lend; him that sum. Mozart, hard pressed himself, could not do without it, but, not liking to refuse, lent Stradler two large répeaters, on which 4 pawnbroker advanced the cash. At the expi- ration of the time for-which the watches were pledged, Stradler was, of course, unprepared, and Mozart was'obliged to find the-50 ducats himself. . Unfortunately, he was: imprudent enough to entrust the money to his debtor, who unserupulously put it in his pocket, and left his too confiding friend to get out of the dilemma in the best way he could.
Lessons like this did not render. him more circumspect. He could not resist the impulses of his heart, and frequently endured privation himself that he might give to others who were not so badly off. . He was naturally generous.
One day at Leipsic, where hé had given a concert, he remembered, just .as he was about starting, that he had not paid his tuner.
‘How much do I owe you?” he asked.
