He had been sent by Charles II. to Paris, to receive further instractions in music from Lulli, the favourite composer of Louis XIV., in whose court the taste, as well as the morals, of Charles had been formed. On the return of Humphrys he distinguished himself so much as a writer of anthems, that it is said his early master, Cook, died from jealousy and grief. This, however, is probably a fiction; but the pupil certainly succeeded his preceptor in the office of master of the children, in 1672, but enjoyed the appointment only about two years, for he died in 1674, in the twenty-seventh year of his age.\r\n",
