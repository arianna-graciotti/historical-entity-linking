He would probably account for the major ninth (Gf not Gb) in it by the custom of modern composers, which he refers to on p. 92 of his book, of combining major and minor harmonies in the same chord. For ourselves, we must confess that we think Richter\u2019s system simpler. He would call ita \u2018\u201c\u2018chromatically altered chord,\u201d and would treat it as the ordinary dominant ninth in a complete form, but with the fifth of the root chromatically raised. The resolution of the chord is regular in both cases; and either explanation appears to us satisfactory.\u2014Tihe Reviewer of \u201c* Stainer's Harmony.\u201d ]\r\n",
