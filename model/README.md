## ENTITY LINKING DYNAMICS

A new model for Entity Linking (EL) particularly suited also for historic texts.
Our approach to EL assumes that the disambiguation process underlying this task has to be coherent with the context in which entities appear, respecting time and logical constraints.
To this end, we developed Entity Linking Dynamics (ELD), an innovative model that is grounded on relaxation labelling processes.
This class of algorithms can produce consistent labelling of the data thanks to the use of constraints among labels designed to make the label assigned to an object consistent with the labels assigned to the other objects in the same batch.
