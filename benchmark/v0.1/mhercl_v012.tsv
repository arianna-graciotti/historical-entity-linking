#sent_text:The concerted works were Beethoven’s third Rasoumowski Quartet in C, Op. 59, and Schumann’s Phantasiestiicke for piano, violin, and violoncello, Op. 88, a series of four movements originally designed as a trio, but afterwards re-named, perhaps on account of their sketchiness, and the absence of regular development, Herr Joachim gave Bach’s Chaconne, his grand rendering of which is too well known to need description, Miss Agnes Zimmermann played Schubert’s Impromptu in C minor, Op. go, and a selection of the Valses Nobles, Op. 77, and Miss Thudichum contributed songs by Purcell and Cowen.
