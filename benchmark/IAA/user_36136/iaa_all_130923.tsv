#sent_text:On the Ist of April following, Judas Maccabeus was reproduced, which had been brought out in the previous year as an ode of victory, a musical ovation, to William, Duke of Cumberland, in honour of his success against the unfortunate Charles Edward ; and, on its reproduction, the song of triumph was interpolated into it from the other work, for, we may well believe, it had already become popular, although it had been first heard but three weeks before, and it embodied to the very life the people’s feelings ; and since that occasion the piece has been integral to both Oratorios.
