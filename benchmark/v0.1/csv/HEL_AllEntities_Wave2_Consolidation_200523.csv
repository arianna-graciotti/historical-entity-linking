In the Hospital for the Insane, a man was confined, literally fanatico per musica ; he had lost his senses on the failure of an opera, in which the labour of the composer was greater than the excellence of his music. This unfortunate had by some accident beard of Camporese, whose fame filled the city, and immediately conceived an ungovernable wish to hear her. For awhile his representations passed unnoticed, he grew ungovernable, and had to be fastened to his bed. In this state Camporese’s friend had beheld him. . She was dressing for an evening party when this representation was made to her.. She paused a moment on hearing it; then, throwing a cloak over her shoulders, said, ‘Come then.’ ‘ Whither?’ ‘Io the Ospedale.’ But why? there.is no occasion to go now—to-morrow, or the next day.’ ‘To-morrow—no, indeed, if I can do this poor man any good let me go instantly.” And they went. Being shown into a room, separated from that ‘of the maniac only by a thin wall, Camporese began to sing one of Haydn’s melodies. The attendants in the next room observed their patient suddenly become less violent, then composed, at last he burst into tears. The singer now entered, she sat down, and sang again. When she had concluded, the poor composer took from under the bed a torn sheet of paper, scored with an air of his own composition, and handed it to her. ‘There were no words, and nothing in the music, but Camporese running it over, sang it to some words of .
Metastasio, with snch sweetness, that the music seemed excellent. ‘Sing it me once more,’ said the maniac. She did so, and departed accompanied by his prayers and the tears of the spectators.” This exhibits a beautiful trait of Madaine Camiporese’s disposition, and we are most happy to add of our own knowledge, that she was in every sense of the term—a gentlewoman—and most amiable in her manners and character.

Court of Spain well deserve that a more complete biography of him than any . that has yet.appeared should be collected. “* No vocal performer of the present century has been.more unanimously allowed by professional critics, as well as general celebrity, to have been gifted with a voice of such uncommon power, “sweetness, extent, and: agility, as Carlo Braschi detto Farinelli. “Nicolini, Senesino, and Carestini gratified the eye as much by the dignity, grace, and propriety of their action and deportment, as the ear by the judicious use of a few notes within the limits of a small compass of voice; but Farinelli without the assistance of ‘significant gestures or graceful attitudes, enchanted and astonished his hearers by the force, extent, and mellifluous tones of the mere organ, when -he had nothing to execute, articulate, or express. But though during the time of his singing he was as motionless as a statue, his voice was so ' active that no intervals were too close, too wide, or two rapid for his execution. It seems as if the composers of these times were unable to invent passages sufficiently difficult to display his powers, or the orchestras to accompany him in many of those which had been composed for his peculiar talent. And yet, so great were his forbearance and delicacy, that he was never known, while he was in England, to exclaim, or manifest discontent at the inability of the band, or mistakes of individuals by whom he wasaccompanied. He was so judicious ‘in proportioning the force of his voice to the space through which it was to pass “to the ears of his audience, that in a small theatre at Venice, though it was then most powerful, one of the managers of the opera complained that he did not. sufficiently exert himself—‘ let me then,’ says Farinelli, have a larger.

Piccini, Pergolesi, Sarti, Sacchini, Paisiello, and Cimarosa, to mention none of the ‘yest, now flourished;" ITALIAN AND ENGLISH COMPOSERS. 163 practically characteristic that they cannot be exceeded, and therefore their intrinsic merits are their preservatives. , ‘I can but admit, that from the time of Purcell to Arne there is a complete hiatus in the history of English dramatic music, and this too was the age when Porpora, Leo, Scarlatti, Galuppi, Vinci, and Jomelli flourished. But, Sir, I cannot help thinking, that our deficiency is not assignable to the want of genius, but to the want ofencouragement. The English could then be said to-have even less taste for opera than at present, deficient as we still are.
I yield, however, completely and unreservedly to the Italians during this period, and I refer those of your readers who may wish to examine a little. further into causes, to the Review of Mr. Bishop’s Operas, at page 198 of your First Volume, where the facts are stated and discussed at some length. Arne was the composer of near thirty pieces, and of Artaxerzes, the only legitimate opera ourstage can boast. Now,Sir, I would ask, does the music of any Italian drama, written at the same time, exhibit more traits of elegance than the songs of Artaxerxes? Does it live with more real popularity attached to it in the country of its production than. Artaxerxes enjoys in England? If not, why then we have had at least one Englishman and one opera which can vie with the children of the great “ nurseofart.” One such instance proves a great deal for my argument, since I cannot admit that our composers are incapable, because the love of opera was not so universal—had not so thoroughly permeated society in England as in Italy at that period. ‘The want of sensibility to the charms of music, or of apprehension, or of taste in the people generally, has nothing to do with the genius of the composers individually. I-esteem such a circumstance to be rather honourable in the comparison I have endeavoured to maintain, because even under the most unfavourable influence, English genius developed and manifested its powers. Nothing can more clearly demonstrate my position than the history of Arne, given in the Review to which [have just referred. From this period to the present day J encounter the giants of the Italian theatre. Piccini, Pergolesi, Sarti, Sacchini, Paisiello, and Cimarosa, to mention none of the ‘yest, now flourished. In the mean while, we have had our Linley, our Shield, and our Storace. Shield is a great man, original, and what is ‘as much to my. purpose, English.

This relation affords our. author a vehicle for some pleasant anecdotes* of this curious character, who lived for the best part of his life in a state of perpetual litigation, imprisonment, and luxury—strange as the mixture may appear. We had opportunities of knowing much of the connections and habits of “The circumstance I am going tq mention may not be misplaced here, as illustrative of the character of Mr. 'I'aylor, one of the most. singular of mankind. A party of friends, with whom this humourist ‘had been dining, had, by well-timed. raillery, driven him to invite them to breakfast, on the morning of the day appointed for laying the foundation of the new theatre. Determined to enjoy a joke at the expense of his friends, and at the same time to be reimbursed for his breakfast, he wrote a note in the name of a comnion friend, to each of the gentlemen who had engaged themselves, to partake of his déjedner.The bitlet informed them that the supposed writer had learned that Taylor intended to practice a joke on his visitors, by sctting them down to empty dishes, and recommending them to turn the tables on him, by taking each man.his provision with him, and-upbraiding their host with his narrow conduct.— The advice was followed by the guests to a man, every one sending or taking in his carriage a supply of provisions more than adequate to his own wants, and the whole number rejoicing in the confusion with which Taylor would, as they expected, be overwhelmed. | Their astonishment was considerable, when, on entering the breakfast-room, with half-suppressed laughter at the anticipated joke, they found the tables set out with the choicest materials for their meal.A good deal of exchange of looks ensded between the guests, terminating in a roar.of laughter, from which none refrained, save only Taylor, who, looking on with suppressed exultation, enjoyed the fun, which was iucreased when the company caused their various importations of game and meats to be introduced.The host very quietly ordered these into his larder, and the company sat down in high glee. . ‘Breakfast over, under pretence of shewing them a valuable picture, Taylor introduced’ his friends into an adjoining room, where, -apologizing for a momentary absence, he left the room, locked the door softly, and set forth to join. the procession to the scite of the new theatre. The unconscious prisoners, beginuing presently to wonder at -his prolonged absence, tried the door of their place of durance, and by repeated knocks and vociferations brought up the servant. ‘I'he man protested he had no key to the door, bat would instantly follow Mr. Taylor and procure it. -This-he did, and the released captives issuing forth were greeted with‘a large placard, announcing. to the public an unparalleled novelty in natural history, in the exhibition of fourteen full-erown jackalls, or lon’s providers, to be seen at the house of Mr. Thomas Taylor, all living in one den, in perfect amity! Finally, after renewed laughter, the jackalls, on posting to the Haymarket, arrived there just after the conclusion of the ceremony, while Taylor expressed his surprize that so contemptible an inducement -as @ wild beast show could have detained them from the foundation. laying.” . a  SEVEN YEARS OF THE KING’S THEATRE. 99 Taylor,* and Mr. Ebers has certainly shewn uo disposition to overcharge the portraiture of his friend’s character..

Albert was the first of that order called minstrels, who was admitted into the royal chapel, but he cannot be said to have established the reputation of _ his instrumentin France; this is universally ascribed to Baltzar.
_ The first band of violins which appears to have been considered at all masical,* was one consisting of twenty-four, and was established at the Court of Louis XIV of France, towards the middle of the 17th century. This band became so celebrated as to raise the reputation of the violin, by its success all over Europe.
Its reputation was however much further advanced, indeed it may be. considered as firmly established, by the talents and exertions of the celebrated Lully, whose brilliant career began at this enoch.

Auber’s music left untouched.;;Auber;person;Q157672;no;Tue production of Auber’s sparkling Opera “Les Diamans de la Couronne,”;"ROYAL ITALIAN OPERA. Tue production of Auber’s sparkling Opera “Les Diamans de la Couronne,” with Madame Patti in the part of Caterina, was naturally looked forward to as the great event of the season; but the version of this composition submitted to the audience of the Royal Italian Opera on the 8rd ult, could have satisfied none but the vocalists and the conductor. In the first place the work suffers from the heavy recitatives, composed according to the “ serious” Italian Opera model, by Signor Vianesi; but this we could forgiye were Auber’s music left untouched. So far from this being the case, however, in addition to ruthlessly cutting out portions of the original, pieces are taken from the composer’s early Operas, “Ta Neige,” and “Leicester,” and introduced without, as we can perceive, the slightest reason ; then a duet and some songs written especially for the occasion by Signor Vianesi, are dragged in with as much coolness as if the Italian Opera stage were merely intended as a platform for the display of the caprices of singers; and, perhaps worst of all, the music of Sebastiano, composed by Auber for a tenor, has been mutilated and altered to please the baritone, Signor Cotogni.

e addressed himself to the Abbé Pellegrine,;;Abbé Pellegrine;person;Q3294482;no; Abbé Perrin;"One of the principal pieces in Hippolyte et Arcie, is the trio of the Fates, one of the most beautiful compositions of Rameau. It is in a style of richness and full harmony, astonishing for the time in which it was written. This was the first time that enharmonic transitions had been made use of in theatrical music, and those in this magnificent trio produced a startling effect; the rifournedle at the beginning is admirable in grandeur and energy, and would not be a disgrace to any of the chefs d’ euvres of the more modern schools. When we are to judge an ancient composer, we should try to forget all those works which have been written since his time, and only to recal those which preceded him, we may then fairly judge of the degree of invention a musician possesses. We may see by this means the enormous distance there is between Rameau and Lully, the most laboured works of the latter being almost childishly simple compared with Rameau’s first opera. It is quite in another style, another orchestra, a new disposition, unknown thythms—in fact with the exception of the overture and the grand fugued choruses after the old style, quite a revolution is apparent, and the distance between Rameau and Lully, is as great as between Gluck and Rameau. The second work It may be remarked as a singular thing, that the first opera played in France was composed and performed by churchmen; the words were by the Abbé Perrin, the music by Lambert, the organist of Saint Honoré, and all the singers were chosen from the various parishes. Until the establishment of the Conservatoire, during the revolution, there was no other singing school in France than those in the cathedrals, in which sacred buildings the theatrical rehearsals always took place.

The Gardens of the Hesperides, which was played at Naples, was universally admired, and by none more than by the Signora M. Benti Bulgarini, better known by her prima-donna name of the Romanini. She was the first singer of her day, and played the part of Venus in that opera; and so delighted was she with its beauty, that she rested not until she had obtained an introduction to the author. On seeing him, the Romanini expressed at once her admiration and esteem, and ‘warmly pressed him to renounce at once the dry study of the law, take up his abode under her husband's roof, and devote his whole time, his whole energies, to the delights of friendship and the inspiration of the Muse.

This opera was very much admired for its great imagination, expression, and originality, by all who heard it—but the young composer himself was so discontented with his work, that he even went so far as to commit the whole of it to the. flames, declaring that he would never compose again, and to this determination he ever after rigidly adhered, contenting himself with arranging for .

Throughout his works however there was such great want of purity and correctncss of style as to be.a constant drawback on the pleasure derived from hearing them, besides considerably decreasing their value-in the esti- mation of connoisseurs. The following is a list of. his operas :- “& Pandolfo.” 1745; “ La Fata maravigliosa,” 1746 ; Olimpiade,” 1747; Il vello d’oro,”’ 1749; “ Chi tutto abbraccia, nulla stringe,” 1753; “ La Cascina and Statira,” 1756 ; “ La Conversazione, Artaserse, and Alessandro nell’ Indie,” 1758; “ Il Ciarlatano,” 1759; “ La. buona Figluola maritata,”’ 1762: “ Donna stravagante and Schiava riconosciuta,” 1766. Andrea Lucchesi was born at Malta, in the Venetian States, in 1741. He however. received his first: instructions. in music at Naples, where he studied sacred composition under 11 Padre Poalucci, the scholar of the Padre Martini, and dramatic under Cochi. He afterwards received further instructions from Saratelli, the predecessor of Galuppi;, as Chapel Master of St. Mark at Venice. In 1771, Lucchesi went with acompany of opera singers _to Bonn, and entered the service of the Elector of Cologne as Chapel Master, with a salary of 1000 florins.. He excelled greatly as a performer on the organ, which instrument he had studied much in Italy. In composition his manner was light, animated, and agreeable, whilst the perfect purity of his style was very remarkable. In his church music he. was however scrupulously exact as torhythm. His operas are “ L’Isola della Fortuna,” at’ Venice, 1765; Jl Marito geloso, at Venice, and “ Le Donne sempre donne,” 1766; “Jl Matrimonio per astusia,’ A771; “Il Giocatore amoroso,” an interlude for two persons.

Metastasio";"We shall subjoin as notes two of the most amusing.* It should Madame Camporese.—* An intimate acquaintance waited on her one morning to make a request. In the Hospital for the Insane, a man was confined, literally fanatico per musica ; he had lost his senses on the failure of an opera, in which the labour of the composer was greater than the excellence of his music. This unfortunate had by some accident beard of Camporese, whose fame filled the city, and immediately conceived an ungovernable wish to hear her. For awhile his representations passed unnoticed, he grew ungovernable, and had to be fastened to his bed. In this state Camporese’s friend had beheld him. . She was dressing for an evening party when this representation was made to her.. She paused a moment on hearing it; then, throwing a cloak over her shoulders, said, ‘Come then.’ ‘ Whither?’ ‘Io the Ospedale.’ But why? there.is no occasion to go now—to-morrow, or the next day.’ ‘To-morrow—no, indeed, if I can do this poor man any good let me go instantly.” And they went. Being shown into a room, separated from that ‘of the maniac only by a thin wall, Camporese began to sing one of Haydn’s melodies. The attendants in the next room observed their patient suddenly become less violent, then composed, at last he burst into tears. The singer now entered, she sat down, and sang again. When she had concluded, the poor composer took from under the bed a torn sheet of paper, scored with an air of his own composition, and handed it to her. ‘There were no words, and nothing in the music, but Camporese running it over, sang it to some words of .
Metastasio, with snch sweetness, that the music seemed excellent. ‘Sing it me once more,’ said the maniac. She did so, and departed accompanied by his prayers and the tears of the spectators.” This exhibits a beautiful trait of Madaine Camiporese’s disposition, and we are most happy to add of our own knowledge, that she was in every sense of the term—a gentlewoman—and most amiable in her manners and character.

Not a syllable is lost of these pathetic harangues. The agony of the father is evident, now in burning accent, and then in faltering tones. The climax, when Jephtha cries, “‘I am no more!” is most affecting ; and the man who is not seen to weep is only hiding his emotions by vociferous cheering. The patriarch was in glorious voice, and it was gratifying to find that the band applauded him most heartily. He was encored in the first recitative, and a consideration only for Mr. Braham prevented the repetition of his second masterly essay in the ‘‘ Deeper and deeper still.’ that this society is flourishing.

This Felix Mendelssohn-is already a mature artist, and yet but fifteen years old.” The idea of maturity took such firm. hold upon Moscheles, that when requested to give the boy lessons he could hardly bring himself to do so, urging that Felix had “no need of lessons.” Ultimately he consented, but took care to write in his diary, “I gave Felix Mendelssohn his first lesson, without losing sight for a single moment of the fact that I was sitting next to a master, not a pupil.” In this connexion we find a reference to Mendelssohn’s parents which may go far to remove an idea. that, conscious of their son’s genius, they unduly forced his powers. ‘‘ They are far from over-rating their children’s talents; in fact, they are anxious about Felix’s future, and to know whether his gift will prove sufficient to lead to a noble and truly great career. Will he not, like so many other brilliant children, suddenly collapse?

The’ Catholie chapels, that is to say, there were plenty of flowers on the altar, ;and plenty of lighted candles also. Besides the sents reserved before the altar for the bride ‘and bridegroom, the bridesmaids and groomsmen, there were seats in the body of the building kept for those friends who were invited to the ceremony: The entrance ‘of the bridesmalds, four in number, attracted the eyes of. the crowded chapel. They were dressed in white with blue wreaths around the head, blue ribands round the neck, and blue sashes: The entrance of the bride herself, accompanied by her father, Signor Patti, created the livelicst interest. among the spectators.

His execution is as neat and rapid, and almost as forcible as the best players of the day—his self-possession not less complete ; and if in any thing we could have discovered the youth of the player, pre‘suming we had not been apprized of the fact, it would have been in the brevity ofthe strains of melody, and in the repetitions of favourite passages of execution, which were traits too remarkable to be missed.. In every other respect there were the marks of acquirement vast at any age, but prodigious at his, and of talent that requires only the assistance of a larger share of acquired ‘knowledge. His genius brightens in his face, and particularly when any thought first rises to his mind. There was an eminent proof of this previous to the commencement of.a fugue with his ' Jeft hand, which he worked with much skill. He feels every note he touches. A Harpist of the name of Labarre also played after this dinner, and his merit is ofa very high order. He does more perhaps in execution than even Bochsa himself has ever done, and his performance is as neat as that of a first rate pianist.

In Signor Nicolini we had quite an ideal Lohengrin, every phase of the character having evidently been studied with an earnestness in the highest degree to be commended. The music, too, lies well within his register, and both his declamatory and cantabile phrases were finely delivered. M. Maurel was excellent as Telramund ; Signor Capponi’s voice told well in the music assigned to the Herald, but Herr Seideman (a new comer), as the King, showed more zeal than power in the important solos which fell to his share. As we have before hinted, the choruses were rough and uncertain throughout. Granted that they are enormously difficult, there is of course additional reason why they should have been reliearsed until competent authorities pronounced them sufficiently perfect to be submitted to a public audience. We are not of those who believe, that because an Opera has been hurried forward, every allowance should be made for all the shortcomings which such a system necessitates. The scenery and dresses were superb, and reflect the utmost credit upon the management. Indeed, the glittering and brilliant armour of the soldiers proved that Henry the Fowler was. not a man to be trifled with, for many well disciplined troops, after so long a march, might have found it difficult to look their best with such a lime light as was thrown upon them on their arrival in Brabant. A good word must be said for Signor Vianesi, the conductor, to whose untiring exertions much of the success of the Opera was due, and who shared with the principal singers, on the fall of the curtain, the warm congratulations of the largest audience ever assembled, we should think, within the walis of this establishment. Imperfectly as Wagner’s ideas have been: realised by the production of one of his representative works with so little preparation, we are thankful to the lessee for at length redeeming the pledge which some time ago he so emphatically gave in his prospectus. Whether English people will grow to the theory which is embodied in this Opera, is still an open question; but neither hostile criticism nor derision are to be dreaded by those who desire to advance the views of the composer in this country. A subscriptionlist may still be essential for the support of an Opera-house, but it has little effect upon the progress of art; and in pronouncing a true opinion upon the Wagnerian Opera, we have more faith in the public than in the subscribers.

In Erard’s: action there is a spring applied which exists in no other action for pianofortes.” By the kindness of the Great London firms he (Sir R. Stewart) was enabled to exhibit werking models of most of these actions of Hopkinson, Erard, and Broadwood, which were most ingenious examples of engineering on a minute scale. The grand pianos of Erard had been identified with the performances of Thalberge (now unfortunately deceased), and of Franz Liszt? who was still alive, but had of late years become an Abbé and given up [?] the world, living in retirement at Weimar. It was‘of Liszt and the Erard piano that Heine had thus spoken in the year 1842, “ He is here,” said the caustic Jew-poet, the “ Attila—the seourge of God to all Erard pianos: which tremble at the first news of his coming, and which now again shiver and bleed, and whimper under his hapa et it becomes a fair.case for the ‘society .for freventing cruelty to animals !’” . Yet, in spite of all the extravagance of his manner and his music, there was something inexpressibly attractive about Liszt, something above and bchind that marvellous executive skill which put. him at the head of, all pianoforte players, There was really a great deal noble and chivalrous about this man, who, disgusted at the tardiness. of those that undertook to'gathey funds for the monument of Beethoven, resolved to become personally responsible fer the completion of the me_morial, and carried out his views too, giving concert after concert for the purpose, nor resting. till he stood proudly before the completed statue to Beetho.

His familiarity with the continental theatres, and his acquaintance with the persons with whom he had to deal, and the situation in which he stood with regard to them, gave him an extensive insight into their ‘private politics which, when bargaining on his own account, could not fail to be highly advantageous to him. ‘The consciousness of this was probably-an argument of great avail in inducing him to undertake the.management; and, no doubt, had due weight. with those by whom he was patronized. ‘These were, the Marquis of Hertford, Earl of Glengall, the Hon. Henry de Roos, and Colonel Cooke, who also forméd Benelli’s Committee, The, agreement between us was, that, though the season, having so far proceeded, was to be concluded under my management, yet that Benelli should take upon himself all the engagements, and be entitled to the receipts from the beginning of the season, indemnifying me from all responsiblity. ‘The members of his Committee gave security for the payment of the rent, and Messrs. Yallop and Chippendale, Mr. Benelli’s solicitors, also gave a bond for the performance of the covenants in the lease.- Had the terms on Benelli’s part been fulfilled, I
should not have afterwards regretted the arrangement; as it-was, I expected their performance, and was not sorry to have escaped from a concern, which.
not only had proved one of loss, but-of great.anxiety, and weighed heavily on my spirits. The money I was to receive from Benelli would go some way towards repaying my losses during the two previous years ; and I felt.a relief at .
being once again free from the knotty intricacies of the concern in which I had been entangled.: The ten thousand pounds were duly paid, and was the only part of the agreement.which Benelli performed, as I shall subsequently have occasion to mention. For my additional security. against the debts, it was stipulated that Mr. Allan, the Secretary to the Theatre under my management, should receive the proceeds of the house, for the purpose of paying off the.
tradesmen’s bills, performers’ engagements, and other demands to which I was” liable during the season, and which Benelli had taken upon himself.” ?";;;TheQuarterlyMusicalMagazineAndReview__1828-037.txt_3954;121363;1828;;;;ERROR;;;

Mr. Charles Hallé’s pianoforte performances were an important feature, Beethoven’s Concerto in C major No. 1, and Sterndale Bennett's Caprice in E, being especially deserving of the highest praise. Madame Antoinette Sterling and Mr. Lloyd achieved the most signal success in the vocal music allotted to them, although the lady was obviously suffering from hoarseness. The festival was brought to a close on the z4th ult., a novelty in the programme being Raff's Symphony in E, No.5, which elicited much applause and excited the deepest interest. .Mr. Hallé was again the pianist, and Madame Sterling and Mr. Lloyd the singers. In every respect the performances have been highly successful, and Mr. Hallé deserves every credit for the admirable manner in which he conducted.

If Mr. Chorley’s criti- cism be occasionally deficient in earnestness, great allowances should be made for the state of the art, the character of the artists, and the mind of the public. In Mendelssohn he had full opportunity. of becoming acquainted with the infer maind of a great musician.

The materials are judiciously chosen, not only because they are intrinsically good, but as being, in their original state, exceedingly well calculated for piano-forte performance. They are ably blended, and the effect of the whole is brilliant and enlivening. But Mr. Potter has not yet learnt to stoop from the heights of science to the useful art of smoothing down difficulties ; he is too fond of crowding together notes in very inconvenient situations, and every now and then he introduces a passage that the majority of performers,—and nat bad ones,—find awkward and teasing, but which, bv a slight alteration, might have been rendered easy, without any sacrifice on the part of the composer. Indeed those passages that are the least commodions for the hand and » ? for fingering, are commonly also the least productive of effect. ‘The very first page of this pot-pourri, or, more: correctly, the Introduction to it,—will serve to exemplify our observation, which we offer to the attention of Mr. Potter, because, considering him as a very distinguished ' musician, we wish to see his productions more widely circulated.

London. For the Author, by the Royal Harmonic Institution.
If glees, the praise and pride of English composers, are now rarely printed, there are several causes which conspire ‘to produce such an effect. The strongest of them unquestionably is, the growing taste for Italian concerted pieces, which now pervades even the provinces. We have minutely described the true construction of the glee, and so often discussed its claims to favour, that it should seem superfluous to add more here. ""We may, however, be permitted to say, that there is no more striking sign of the times (musically speaking) than the decline of the regard towards this species of composition. For the English glee addresses itself exactly and comprehensively to those affections which used to be the characteristics of the mind of the country.
It ean be sublime or pleasing, solemn, soothing, or airy. Indeed even -the voluptuous intensity before which this species of writing is fading into insipidity, was not wanting to some of our part songs ; for instance, Lord Mornington’s “How sweet, how fresh, this vernal day.’ But English glees, as a whole, certainly cannot vie in dramatic force, if they may be thought by their admirers to compare in other respects with Italiandramatic concerted pieces—and as nothing short of dramatic force will now affect the general mind, from the constant succession of strong stimulus applied in every possible shape—the glee, with all other gentler gratifications that agitate less at the time, and please as much on reflection as in enjoyment, is rapidly sinking into the catalogue of things no longer worthy to be remembered by the sons and daughters of an age of excess. Mr. Walmisley, in spite of these discouragements, adheres to the purer form of writing. ";;;TheQuarterlyMusicalMagazineAndReview__1824-022.txt_3086;118031;1824;;;;1680;;;

‘man (say the antient philosophers) is an imitative animal,” and accordingly. no sooner did these works appear, than numerous copies were got ready according to pattern, and in various degrees"" of difficulty, and sent forth into the world. Mr. Pixis’s however is the only one we shall select to class with Mr. M.’s as sufficient to afford scope for the remarks we would make on the subject.
The piano forte is susceptible of various characters under the hands ofa skilful artist, but there are yet some requisites m compositions for it, without which neither mind nor ear can be satisfied.
‘Thus itis most difficult to render vocal passages and compositions suitable for the piano forte, because in general it is impossible to give the voice part ether harmony enough for the instrument, or _to give it the expression it demands, when separated from its words, whilst to the accompaniment (if orchestral) it is still less practicable to render due effect. All these obstacles however Mr. Moscheles has overcome in his Gems @ la Pasta, and produced a charming lesson. The means he employed were such a8 could alone ensure him success. He selected beautiful and attractive melodies, and such as were wéll known amongst the rifioramenti of Pasta, and he only took such parts and introduced such of her “Gems” as were best adapted to the gentus of the instrument, added to which be it understood that Madame Pasta’s graces do not alone consist in mere roulades, they are more of the mind than of the voice. Now the taste and elegance necessary in the treatment of such subjects are inherent in Mr. M.’s own style.";;;TheQuarterlyMusicalMagazineAndReview__1828-037.txt_4258;121598;1828;;;;1775;;;

Storace obtained great credit for the manner in which this was produced; but the intrigues of an Italian theatre soon drove away this sensible, able ’ manager, and he retired to Bath, where, for a while, he gave up in disgust his musical pursuits, and devoted his attention to drawing, an art for which he possessed a . very considerable share of talent and a fine taste.

The style of this opera differs considerably from that of Elisabetta.;;Elisabetta;opera;Q261831;no;Rossini;"The first opera he composed for the theatre of San-Carlo. was Elisabetta, This opera had extraordinary success, . resulting equally from a brilliant and energetic style, and from a novelty of ideas (which is now not often the case) and from its perfect execution in the youthful talents of Madlls. Colbran and Dardanelli, the celebrated tenor David, and the peculiar baritone Nozzari.* The Neapolitans recognized in Rossini the mah who was soon to be captivated by their beautiful country ; in fact if Venus (as Schubart said of Naumann) had wished for a chapel master, her choice would infallibly have fallen upon Rossini; such charms do his melodies possess. Thus he has received proofs of the highest favour of the Neapolitan public. A decree of the Duke of Noia, superintendent of the royal theatres, declared in the most flattering terms his superiority over all his predecessors, and engaged him to write in the same. style for the teatro massimo (thus do the Italians distinguish San Carlo.) So many proofs of general admiration could not however prevent his. writing a farce in. the summer of: 1816, in the lowest style, under the title : of La Gazzetta, by which his laurels were for a time tarnished ; but- happily he had already in his portfolio the Libretto of Otello, and two montlis were sufficient for him to bring forth this chef deuvre of lyric tragedy, as the Italians call it. ‘The style of this opera differs considerably from that of Elisabetta.
